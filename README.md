# Thumb-Controlled-Assistant-Finger
An outline of a moveable 3D printed finger with the logic coded in Arduino for a university project. 

# Overview
The purpose of this project was originally for a university project, but I thought I'd share it, for anyone who thinks it's somewhat fun and would try to replicate or improve it. The aim was to try and create a somewhat simple and moveable finger, controlled through motion detection by a accelerometer attached to the thumb. All of the code was written using Arduino, and the finger was designed using Fusion 360. 

# Objective
The goal of the project was to create a piece of assistive technology that, as the name suggests, would be able to help out a group of people in some way. Although not a major injury, the loss of fingers is still a relevant issue, especially with respect to humans operating and interacting with large machineries, such as in factories. As such, it was decided that designing and making an assistive finger would be helpfu and useful, as well as not being too ambitious but still exciting and challenging at the same time.

# Components Used
* Arduinu Uno

* ULN2003 Driver Board
* Grove MMA7660 3-axis Accelerometer
* Grove Base Shield V2.0 for Arduino
* Push button
* 10k ohm resistor
* Jumper wires and cables
* 3D printed finger
* Fishing line

All of the technological components were limited by what was provided in the subject.

The modifications made were to remove the numbering on the fingers and to reduce the pulley mechanism size to fit better onto our hands, also hole sizes for knuckles were decreased to user paperclips as joint axels.

Designing in Fusion 360:
This project makes use of Autodesk Fusion 360, Educational Licence for 3D modeling and design aspects. Fusion 360 is a powerful CAD/CAM software tool that has been instrumental in developing the 3D models used in this project. It was used to design the "Finger and Pulley" STL.
