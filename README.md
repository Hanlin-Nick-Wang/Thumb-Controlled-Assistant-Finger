# Thumb-Controlled-Assistant-Finger
An outline of a moveable 3D printed finger with the logic coded in Arduino for a university project. 

# What is this used for
For anyone who wants to try and create a somewhat simple and moveable finger, controlled through motion detection by a accelerometer attached to the thumb. All of the code was written using Arduino, and the finger was designed using Fusion 360. Even though the purpose of this project was originally for a university project, the design process was creatively challenging and fun.
