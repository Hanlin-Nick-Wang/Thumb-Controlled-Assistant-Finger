# Thumb-Controlled-Assistant-Finger
An outline of a moveable 3D printed finger with the logic coded in Arduino for a university project. 

# Overview
The purpose of this project was originally for a university project, but I thought I'd share it, for anyone who thinks it's somewhat fun and would try to replicate or improve it. The aim was to try and create a somewhat simple and moveable finger, controlled through motion detection by a accelerometer attached to the thumb. All of the code was written using Arduino, and the finger was designed using Fusion 360. 

# Objective
The goal of the project was to create a piece of assistive technology that, as the name suggests, would be able to help out a group of people in some way. Although not a major injury, the loss of fingers is still a relevant issue, especially with respect to humans operating and interacting with large machineries, such as in factories. As such, it was decided that designing and making an assistive finger would be helpfu and useful, as well as not being too ambitious but still exciting and challenging at the same time.
